## Welcome

Welcome | Welkom | Benvenuti e Benvenute | to repository of the project "Building a Community around the Open Science MOOC". Here you'll find more information about our project and how you can contribute.

## The problem

The Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands runs once a year a Massive Online Open Course on Open Science on the edX platform: 
[MOOC Open Science: Share you research with the world.](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:DelftX+OS101x+2T2022/home)

This course is meant for students, researchers, support staff, policy makes that want to learn the basic and principle of Open Science.

The number of participants per run changes, but while some of them actively contribute to the discussion fora writing and responding to other comments, general engagement is still quite limited, with high dropout rates. Another issue is that we do not know if participants engage with open science activities or join local open science community after the course.

## Our Solution

- Create engaging and inclusive course material motivating the participants to embrace Open Science.
- Show the importance of community in Open Science, stimualting the participants to be part of their local one.

Here our vision:
"We work with a team of teachers at TU Delft to run a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) on Open Science. We want to design an engaging course that shows the participants the advantages of Open Science and motivate them to join and contribute to the Open Science movement."

## Who we are
We [Lisanne Walma (she/her)](https://github.com/lwbwalma) and [Alessandra Candian (she/her)](https://github.com/AleCandian) are the project initiators. We are colleague at TU DElft and friends with a passion for education.

The creation of a MOOC stands on the contribution of many people at TU Delft including developers of content for specific modules (Introduction, Open Data, Open Access Publishing, FAIR Software, Visibility and Citizen Science), moderators, educational designers and developers, administrative staff and media/communication staff.

## Contribution
What ever contribution you can make, even 10' minutes of your time is truly appreciated.
We need expertise in community engagement (in particular MOOC), open working and educational design and _feedback_ along the way. This is the link to our Roadmap: [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1W9wEz-sdAQ0xRujNaaIlUtDKsEHCQ98U1Xrf3jSR4/edit#)


If you have any ideas about the above, please get involved.
